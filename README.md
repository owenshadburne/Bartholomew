This python based program is a silly program designed to "help" users rewrite their sentences. 
This was a group project; I worked on UI and interactions while my two other teammates coded the backend and the silly antics of Bartholomew.
This was written in my senior year of high school as a part of my Computer Science Independent Studies class.

# Lord Bartholomew -- A sentence rewriter for the moder ages
#### Created by Giancarlo, Pedro, and Owen


#### Your Sentence
To use Lord Bartholomew, begin by typing the sentence you want rewriten in the first text box.
From here, you have two options.

#### Reserved words
You can type words you do not want to have changed into the second text box.
If you want to include a base set of reserved words including prepositions, pronouns,
and other basic words, you can check the box next to "Include Default Reserved Words"


#### Word Replacement Value
The slider just below the reserved words will allow you to adjust the exact percent
chance the program will change the words in your sentence. 0 means no words will
change, and 100 means every word will change (excluding reserved words).


#### Submitting
Once you have finished with all of the above, you can press the button "Rewrite Your Sentence"
to, well, rewrite your sentence.


#### Extras
Lord Bartholomew has an attitude, and will sometimes throw a little tantrum...
You'll see. Nobody's writing is up to par for him.
